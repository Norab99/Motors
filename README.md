# Motors

There ara three systems for three different types of motors that used with robotics.

The First System (Two DC Motors): They are working in two direction with constatnt speed and the user can change the direction by change the state of the slide switch.


The Second System (Two Servo Motors): They move according to the value of the input angle, and the angle value can be controlled by variable resistance or joystick in the real life.


The Third System (One Stepper Motor): It is move with constatnt speed and the direction and the angle of the motor can be adjusted using two push buttons.


The Fourht System (One DC Motor with Relay): This System use realay and arduino to control the DC motor on both direction forward and backward, the direction can be adjusted by changing the state of the slide switch.
